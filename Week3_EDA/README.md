# Titanic EDA Project
## Dataset Overview
- Source: Public GitHub Repository
- Objective: Clean, Explore and Vizualize the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover patterns that influenced survival outcomes

---

## Data Cleaning
To ensure accurate analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed
- Handled missing values:
- 'Age': Filled using median imputation
- 'Embarked': Filled using median imputation
- 'Cabin': Dropped due to excessive missing data
- Converted categorical variables:
- 'Sex', 'Embarked', and 'Survived'' were encoded for analyis

## Key Insights
### 1. Gender and Survival
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- This supports historical accounts of evacuation priorities.

### 2.  Passenger Class
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate.

### 3. Age Distribution
- Children had slightly better survival odds.
- Most survivors were between ages 20-40.

### 4. Fare
- Higher fares were weakly correlated with survival.
- Indicates that wealthier passengers had better access to lifeboats.

### 5. Embarkation Point
- Passengers from Cherbourg(C) had the highest survival rate.
- Southampton (S) had the lowest.
