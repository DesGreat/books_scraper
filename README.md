# 📚Books Scraper
This project contains a Python script that scrapes book data from a publicly available website. The goal is to collect structured data that could be used for future Natural Language Processing
(NLP) or Machine Learning (ML) tasks.
## 🔍 What it Does

- Scrapes book titles, prices, and ratings
- Cleans and formats the data
- Prepares it for analysis or modeling

## Ethical Considerations
This scraper respects the site's 'robots.txt' and avoids scraping sites with restrictions. It uses polite request intervals and does not overload the server.
## Future Directions

- Sentiment analysis on book descriptions
- Price prediction models
- Recommendation systems based on ratings

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter and run the cells sequentially. Make sure you have internet access to fetch the data.
